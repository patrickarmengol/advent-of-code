# advent of code

These are my solutions to the advent of code problems. They were done during the events for their respective years. Don't expect much; most of the code is likely ugly, convoluted, and nooby, but I do remember feeling chuffed about at least some of my solutions.

I like advent of code as a challenge, and I expect to, at some time, look at earlier years' problems to help hone my programming skills further. I might even redo/finish the years I've already tried.
